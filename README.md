# Sales-Analysis-Dashboard
I have made a dashboard using PowerBI. I used Transform data to filter out the data. 
This Power BI dashboard provides a concise and insightful overview of sales performance, covering volume, trends, geography, product preferences, and deal segmentation. The use of filters, KPIs, and visual variety ensures users can quickly drill down into key areas like seasonal spikes, regional strengths, and top-performing products — making it an excellent executive-level summary for business decisions.

Sales by Deal Size
Medium-sized deals bring in the most revenue, way ahead of small and large ones. Clearly, that’s where the bulk of the action is.

Sales by Month
November sees a sharp jump in sales, likely due to seasonal factors or promos. December drops a bit, maybe because people already spent big.

Sales by Country
North America and Europe are the top players in sales. Other regions show activity, but the volume is much lower.

Products
Classic and Vintage Cars are fan favorites. Trains and Ships? Not so much.
